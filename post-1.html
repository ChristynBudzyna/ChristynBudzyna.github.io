    <p class="blog-text">       I feel like I should start this blog with an obligatory "Hello world!" My name is Christyn and I'm writing to you from New York City, where I have just begun learning to code at Dev Bootcamp.  Dev Bootcamp is a four month long immersive experience where you learn different coding languages, and more importantly, <i>how</i> to learn to code.  I'm just starting out in "Phase 0", the two month work-from-home portion, and am really enjoying it. </p>
    <p class="blog-text">
          For the past few months, I've been diving into coding as much as possible through self teaching and taking classes online and in person at General Assembly.  I've been focusing on Ruby and Javascript, two of the major languages taught at DBC.  While I'm here, I am planning to push myself as hard as possible so I can gain the skills to make beautiful websites and apps. I am always striving to make beautiful things: I am also a musical theatre lyricist and an avid knitter.  This blog will track my progress throughout Dev Bootcamp, and I hope I can teach you a little about coding too!

      <p class="blog-text">
          During our first week at Dev Bootcamp, my cohort (called the Fiery Skippers!) focused on learning the command line and how to implement version control using Git and Github.

      <h2 class = "blog-h2">The Command Line</h2>

      <p class="blog-text">
        If you open the terminal on your computer, (command-spacebar, type in "terminal"), a magical box of wonders appears!  Well, maybe it doesn't look so magical at first, but it can do amazing things.  You can think of the command line as a super charged version of your "Finder."  In your terminal, you can navigate to all the files in your computer, find out information about them, create, delete, copy, and edit files and directories (a fancy word for folder), search for text in a file, change permissions on a file, run code, and SO MUCH MORE! We focused on repeating and memorizing the basic navigational commands.  Here are a few of them you can try out.
      </p>

      <ul class="blog-list">
        <li>pwd - Print working directory - This shows you the directory you are currently in.</li>
        <li>hostname - Show my computer's network name </li>
        <li>mkdir folder_name - Make a new directory </li>
        <li>rmdir folder_name - Remove a directory </li>
        <li>touch file_name - Create a file </li>
        <li>rm file_name - Remove a file </li>
        <li>ls - List everything inside a directory</li>
        <li>cd - Change to a new directory</li>
        <li>cp - Copy a file or directory</li>
        <li>Mv - Move a file or directory</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="blog-text">
        I have a list of about 30-40 commands that I am working to commit to memory.  Using the command line really makes you feel powerful and in control of your computer.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-h2">Version Control- Git and GitHub</h2>

      <p class="blog-text">

The other big theme of the week was version control.  Programmers use version control to keep track of all of the different drafts of a file.  This prevents confusion when they want to go back to a previous version of a file.  This also allows multiple people to be working on a file without getting in each other's way.

Using the terminal, you can install software called Git to any directory on your computer, and it will track each version of the file.  You need to remember to create saving points or "commits" when you make a change you'd like to save.  Thereâ€™s a four step process for this.
      </p>
      <ol class= "blog-list">
        <li>The first step is to initialize git on your directory.  You can either clone your directory from github using "git clone file_name" or initialize it on your machine using "git init file_name"</li>
        <li>Once you make your changes to the file, check the status using "git status.""  It should say that there is a file that needs editing.</li>
        <li>Use "git add file_name" to add your file to the staging area.  You can add all your files using "git add ."</li>
        <li>Use "git commit -m "Message here" to commit your changes and save your work! </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="blog-text">It's also a good idea to store your code on the website, Github.  This creates a version of your file that lives in the cloud, so you'll still have your work in case your computer crashes and burns in some horrible accident.  You can also share your code with the world on Github!</p>

<p id="caption"><i>Use GitHub and don't lose your code if this happens!</i></p>


<p class="blog-text">Hope you enjoyed my first blog post!  Next week will be my first time pair programming and we'll be delving into HTML.

Have a wooonderful day!

<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was nice to be able to bounce ideas off of each other and look at different designs together.He brought up ideas that I hadn't thought about before.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
It's really nice to see everything laid out before going about building it.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We wanted to keep it clean and simple, without a lot of bells and whistles, and with the focus on the blog post itself.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? I learned about adding an id to an aside tag, and about the textarea tag.  -->
