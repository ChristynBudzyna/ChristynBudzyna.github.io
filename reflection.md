What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

This exercise helped me better understand the difference between the three of them.  I am now thinking of it like a packed mailing box - the content is the object in the box, the padding is the packing kernels around the content, the border is the box itself, and the margin is the space between the box and other items.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I found it a little tricky and required a lot of trial and error.  I tried to avoid using floats as much as possible, using block and inline block positioning instead.  I ran out of time to fix the footer on my blog page- still unsure of how to make it clear the two column layout.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Elements that I found easy to apply were simple things like fonts and colors.  Positioning was the most difficult element for me to implement.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I found out the importance of making classes and ids very quickly when adding another html page to my css file!  I feel like I have a much better understanding of how to use selectors after this challenge.
