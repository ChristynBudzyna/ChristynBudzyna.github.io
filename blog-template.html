<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was nice to be able to bounce ideas off of each other and look at different designs together.He brought up ideas that I hadn't thought about before.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
It's really nice to see everything laid out before going about building it.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We wanted to keep it clean and simple, without a lot of bells and whistles, and with the focus on the blog post itself.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? I learned about adding an id to an aside tag, and about the textarea tag.  -->
