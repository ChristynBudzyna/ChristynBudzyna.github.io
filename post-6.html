    <h1 class = "blog-header">Objects in Javascript vs. Hashes in Ruby</h1>
    <div class = "date">3/18/16</div>
    <p class="blog-text">This week at Dev Bootcamp, the intrepid Fiery Skippers bravely marched into the land of Javascript! I have a basic background in Javascript, but after working for several weeks in Ruby, it took a little adjusting to write code in a different language.  The great thing is, there are a lot of similarities between the two languages, so a lot of this week was about memorizing syntax, because I already understood the general concepts from knowing Ruby. One concept in Ruby that has a psuedo "Javascript equivalent" is the concept of hashes in Ruby and objects in Javascript.</p>

    <p class="blog-text">There are a lot of resemblances between Javascript objects and Ruby hashes.
      <ul>
        <li>Both of them house pairs of data in a larger structure.</li>
        <li>You can access their values, add and delete them, iterate over them, and much more.</i>
        <li>They're both great for storing larger quantities of data in pairs </p>
      </ul>

     <p class="blog-text">They also have some differences:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>In Javascript, objects contain properties, while in Ruby, hashes contain key:value pairs</li>
        <li>A Javascript object can take a function as a value, while a Ruby hash cannot take a method.</i>
        <li>Javascript does not have enumerable iterators, so you have more options for iteration with Ruby hashes.</p>
      </ul>


<p class="blog-text">Check out the syntax for working with Javascript objects and Ruby hashes!</p>

  <h2 class = "blog-h2">Syntax Differences</h2>
    <div class = "pic-container">

  </div>

<p class="blog-text">You can think about objects and hashes in similar ways, but it's important to know the differences between the two.  It's interesting to look at the syntaxes and see how the creator of Ruby, Yukihiro Matsumoto, was inspired by older languages like Javascript and set out to make a language that was more programmer friendly.  I am definitely finding that Ruby is more me-friendly, but that may change as I get more comfortable with Javascript syntax.  Until next week! </p>
